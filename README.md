## Description
The iOS weather app using MVVM architecture and OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api).

# MVVV-C

MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) is a design pattern that can be used to structure iOS applications written in Swift. The pattern is a combination of the traditional MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern and the Coordination pattern.

Model: The model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for fetching, storing and manipulating the data.

View: The view is responsible for displaying the data to the user. It communicates with the ViewModel to get the data and displays it to the user.

ViewModel: The ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It retrieves the data from the Model and prepares it for display in the View. It also handles any user interactions and updates the Model accordingly.

Coordinator: Coordinators are responsible for navigation and flow control in the application. They handle the transition between different screens and pass data between them.

The MVVM-C pattern helps to separate concerns and make the code more modular and testable. It also allows for a cleaner separation of the UI and business logic, making it easier to maintain and extend the application over time
